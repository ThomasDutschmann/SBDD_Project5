- ER_beta has low AF1-activity in contrast to ER_alpha, hence SERMs are almost exclusively agonists for ER_beta.
- Good ER_beta agonist: Erteberel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erteberel)
- To attain strong selectivity, the ligand must place substituents very close to one or more of the amino acid differences between ERα and ERβ in order to create a strong repulsive force towards the other subtype receptor. In addition, the structure of the ligand must be rigid. Repulsive interactions may otherwise lead to conformational change of the ligand and, therefore, creating alternative binding modes.
